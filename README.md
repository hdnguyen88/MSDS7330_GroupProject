MSDS 7330 Group Project

#By Cam Lu, Joshua Balson, and Hieu Nguyen

#The data is from (https://www.kaggle.com/chicago/chicago-taxi-rides-2016/data). 

#Our goal is to analyze taxi rides taken in Chicago from 2013 through 2017 to determine whether the city of Chicago is “centralized”. 

#Since the data file is too large to download, we copy the csv link (https://data.cityofchicago.org/api/views/wrvz-psew/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD) to MongoDB and download the data from there.
